# 🧹 codemap

**A code janitor for AI coding agents.** Point it at any repo and it draws an
**interactive architecture map**, scores **every module 0–100** for technical debt, and
helps you **pay down the cruft** — incrementally, one commit at a time.

> Every codebase accumulates cruft over time — monkeypatches, silent fallbacks, dead
> "legacy" paths, half-finished stubs, copy-pasted duplication, god-files, and valueless
> glue. **codemap surfaces that rot, ranks it, and hands an AI agent a clear punch-list to
> fix it** — with a regression-gated fix loop: a change is accepted only when an
> independent check shows your tests still pass.

## Install

codemap follows the open **Agent Skills** standard (a folder with a `SKILL.md`), now shared
by **Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor**. Clone it into the tool's `skills/` folder and it
auto-discovers as **`/codemap`** — no extra config:

```bash
# Claude Code — global skills folder
git clone https://github.com/Asixa/codemap-skill ~/.claude/skills/codemap

# OpenAI Codex — global skills folder
git clone https://github.com/Asixa/codemap-skill ~/.codex/skills/codemap

# Cursor — global skills folder
git clone https://github.com/Asixa/codemap-skill ~/.cursor/skills/codemap
```

Restart the tool (or start a new session) and type **`/codemap`**. All three also accept a
**per-project** install — drop the `~/` (e.g. `.cursor/skills/codemap` at the repo root).
Cursor additionally reads the Claude/Codex skills dirs, and Codex + Cursor also share a
tool-neutral `~/.agents/skills/`, so one global install can cover several tools. An agent
**without** Skills support: clone it anywhere and point it at the repo's `AGENTS.md`.

> The skill folder (the tool) is separate from each project's **`<project>/.codemap/`**
> folder, where codemap writes its output.
>
> Windows PowerShell: replace `~` with `$env:USERPROFILE` (e.g. `$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\codemap`).

## Why codemap

Most "architecture diagram" tools draw *files and imports*. codemap is different:

- **Functional modules, not files.** It groups code into the capabilities that actually
  matter (a store, a handler group, a feature, a plugin) and lays them out along the
  real data-flow.
- **It grades the rot.** Every module gets a health **score (0–100) and grade (A–F)** plus
  concrete `file:line` findings, hunting specifically for the smells that make code
  unmaintainable: `monkeypatch`, `fallback`, `silent-except`, `legacy`/dead code, `stub`,
  `fake-output`, `dual-format`, `bloat`, `duplication`, `glue`, `god-component`, …
- **Independent, honest scoring.** Each module is audited by a **separate AI subagent**
  against a fixed rubric — no single pass rubber-stamping the whole repo.
- **Incremental + git-aware.** A per-module content hash + the last-run commit mean re-runs
  only re-audit what changed, and `update` shows you the **commits since last time** and
  which modules they touched.
- **Retained website/game audits.** After actual website or game changes, the first
  completed audit is retained as a full immutable version; later changes create
  incremental versions with source and module deltas instead of rewriting history.
- **Regression-gated cleanup.** `fix` runs a four-role loop — lock a test baseline →
  fix → an **independent acceptance check** must show the pre-fix tests still pass → re-score.

It's the maintenance pass you never have time to do, turned into something an agent can
run on a schedule.

> **What it is (and isn't).** codemap is an agent-orchestration framework that makes the
> map + audit *consistent and reviewable* — deterministic scripts handle LoC, hashing,
> staleness, filtering and rendering, and a fixed rubric forces `file:line` evidence and
> an independent audit per module. But the **module decomposition and the scores are model
> judgments**, not the output of a deterministic static analyzer. Treat the map as a
> high-quality, reviewable starting point — and commit `modules.json` so every score is
> diffable in PRs.

## Screenshots

**Click any module** to highlight what it calls (downstream) and what depends on it
(upstream), with its score, smell tags, and `file:line` findings:

The **Audit report** — averages, grade spread, worst offenders, smell-tag frequency, and
cross-cutting themes:

- **Health vs coupling** color modes — problems pop amber/red, healthy modules recede to a
  muted green (colorblind-friendly; the cue is saturation, not just hue).
- **Filter** by grade (≤ B/C/D/F) or by issue tag; jump straight to the worst offenders.
- **Editable Standard page** — change descriptions, **add your own issue tags** to capture
  *your* definition of a problem, and Export to `standard.json`; future audits use it.
- **i18n** — English or Chinese UI (`meta.lang`); module names are never translated.
- **Copy-fix button** on each module — copies `/codemap fix <module>` to paste into your agent.

## Languages

Language-agnostic. LoC and hashing work on **any** text source and `paths` are plain globs,
so it covers **Python, TypeScript/JS, Rust, C#/.NET, C/C++, Go, Java, Swift**, and more.

## Requirements

- **Python 3** — standard library only. No `pip install`, no external packages.
- **An AI coding agent** to drive the audit/fix/test steps — **Claude Code**, **Codex**,
  **Cursor**, or any agent that reads instructions and spawns sub-tasks (see Install).
- A browser to open the generated HTML. That's it.

## Usage

Talk to your agent in plain language, or use the subcommands (shown as Claude Code slash
commands — say the same verb to any other agent). On the first run, codemap asks your
preferences (UI language, output location, project title) and saves them to
`<project>/.codemap/config.json`. Everything it produces lives in `<project>/.codemap/`.

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/codemap init` | first build: ask prefs → decompose into modules → scan → audit every module → render |
| `/codemap check` | read-only: is the map stale? shows commits since last run + drifted / new / deleted modules |
| `/codemap update` | incremental + git-aware: re-audit only changed modules, re-render |
| `/codemap version status` | compare current website/game source and audit state with the latest retained version |
| `/codemap version publish` | retain a completed full or incremental audit as the next immutable version |
| `/codemap version verify` | independently verify retained bytes, audit semantics, compatibility and the version chain |
| `/codemap test <module>` | generate a regression-net of tests for a module |
| `/codemap fix <module>` | regression-gated cleanup: lock baseline → fix → independent acceptance → re-score |

## How it works

```
modules.json  ──scan.py──▶  + LoC, content hash & git diff (stale = hash != auditedHash)
     │                       (decomposition + module descriptions: authored by the agent)
     │◀─apply_audit.py──   one INDEPENDENT subagent's score, validated + atomically written
     │◀─query.py──────────  token-cheap targeting (by grade / tag / severity / staleness)
     ├──render.py────────▶  codemap.html + codemap.md
     └──version.py───────▶  shared semantic preflight + receipt + immutable hash chain
```

`modules.json` is the source of truth (commit it for an audit history); only its
decomposition/structural fields are hand-maintained. Audit facts (`score`, `grade`,
`tags`, `findings`, `audited*`) are accepted only through `apply_audit.py`. The HTML/MD
are pure projections, regenerated by `render.py`. **Four separate subagent roles, never
merged:** *auditor* (scores), *test-author* (writes tests), *fixer* (changes code),
*acceptance/verifier* (proves no regression). Tests are the regression net and are kept
out of a module's own audit scope.

### Reading verification results

`version.py verify` reports separate trust layers: `integrityValid` proves retained
bytes and the hash chain are unchanged; `semanticValid` proves those bytes still satisfy
the shared audit contract; `compatibilityStatus` says whether the history uses the
current receipt contract, a read-only legacy contract, or is semantically invalid.
**A valid hash alone never proves that an audit is meaningful.**

## Customizing the standard (define your own code smells)

The scoring standard is **data, not code** (`reference/standard.json`: rubric, severities,
coupling, and issue tags with descriptions). Open the **Standard** page in the map → **Edit**
→ tweak descriptions, **add your own tags**, then **Export** to
`<project>/.codemap/standard.json`. Custom tags flow through the whole map and are used by
future audits. The prose version + the exact subagent prompt live in `reference/STANDARDS.md`.
